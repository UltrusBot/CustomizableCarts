Customizable Carts adds a variety of new minecarts, each with a unique design, and all created through simple json files that you can create and put in datapacks to add your own minecarts.

## Questions & Answers
**Will this be on neoforge in the future?**

Yes! The first full release will be on neoforge & fabric. This mod was made for [Modfest: Carnival](https://modfest.net/carnival) so I originally only developed it on fabric.


**How do I add my own carts?**

I plan on writing up a wiki detailing the cart creation process, but for now you can just follow by example, and look at the json files for the current carts [here](https://github.com/UltrusBot/CustomizableCarts/tree/main/src/main/generated/data/customizablecarts/customizablecarts/cart_body)
